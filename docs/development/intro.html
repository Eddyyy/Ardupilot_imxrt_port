<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>These are my initial thoughts starting the project. I had a very basic idea of what I wanted to do
but didn't have any specific intentions behind it other than to learn. As we will see later that
changed.</p>
<h2>Requirements (sort of)</h2>
<h3>Need to have</h3>
<ol>
<li>Chip to run the control algorithms</li>
<li>IO to actuators and propulsion</li>
<li>IMU or IMU port</li>
<li>Telemetry IO</li>
<li>Sensor IO</li>
</ol>
<h3>Extra</h3>
<ol>
<li>Potential power supply</li>
<li>CC or Accelerator connection (PCIE or usb or serial or something)</li>
<li>IO Processor or FPGA</li>
</ol>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>First researching was done based on the type of processors that are being used in flight controllers
 and the new ones being developed today. One of the big things I was looking for was a chip that
may be able to provide something not currently available in Ardupilot based drones built now. I had
also been working on a brushed DC motor speed controller which had lead me through the stm32
ecosystem.  One thing I had felt it was missing was a high speed processing MCU. I hadn't looked
into the STM32H7 family now being developed into the Cube Orange flight controller and the MatekH7
flight controller.</p>

<p>Something that had recently come into my mind was the Teensy 4.0 which had a clock speed of
600 MHz which was far faster than any of the F4s and F7s of the STM32 family. I had also spoken to 
friends who were amazed and very impressed by this new MCU. I was also surprised at the tiny size
the Teensy from work with the 3.2 version in earlier projects. Finally I recently found further
support and praise for a similar processor in a forum that I follow. All this lead me to look into
the

line of processors by NXP.</p>
