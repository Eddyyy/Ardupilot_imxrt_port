This project contains all the source code required for the blinky project under the nxp sdk. The aim
of this project is to compile the project from the nxp sdk using make files and to understand
the requirements for a basic IMXRT project. Currently the project is being built for the IMXRT1020
processor but could likely be easily expanded later.
